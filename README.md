## Background
This was originally a homework assignment from one of my university computer science courses, however I've decided to recreate it in a JavaFX app.

## Dependencies
 - org.json Jar file.
 - javafx sdk 11+.

You'll also need your own NASA Near Earth Object Database API key (it should replace the comment in the beginning of
the NEODatabase.java file).
