This was originally a homework assignment from one of my university computer science courses, however I've decided to recreate it in a JavaFX app.

Dependencies:
 - org.json Jar file.
 - javafx sdk 11+.

You'll also need your own NASA Near Earth Object Database API key (it should replace the comment in the beginning of
the NEODatabase.java file).

Please feel free to fork this project and edit it in any way you'd like for your own use. I've included the Controller.java file for this reason,
even though I didn't use it myself.
